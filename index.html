        <div class="subheading mb-5">Statistics ùùÖ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Sharvee Joshi, but I go by Charlotte. I am currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a statistics major hoping to further my education in the field by applying for graduate school; my ultimate goal, however, is to one day receive a PhD in Statistics and open up my own consulting company. While I am not coding SAS or R, I like to model, preferably in nature. Currently, I have no upcoming photoshoots, but I hope to add more to my portfolio once I graduate. I am also part of a sorority of campus, and devote some time to my sisters as well. In the past four years, I have spent time learning about different methods and applications of statistics, and I have narrowed down my interests in coding and risk management. I hope to learn more about actuary science and build up a resume from there. In terms of professional experience, I tutor elementary school children whenever I can. I also proofread college essays and provide insight to high school students on how to build their first resume. <br><br>

        As mentioned before, I am currently applying for graduate schools to further my education in statistics. Education was always valued in my family, as my parents were immigrants from India. I was taught to value the importance of a good education because other people are not as fortunate. Because of this, my love for knowledge increased and I take every class seriously, putting my all into them. If I were to receive a PhD, not only would I start my own company, I believe that I would continue to tutor and mentor high school and undergraduate students as I would have a good amount of insight and advice to give them. Besides applying for graduate school, I currently am teaching myself more coding languages such as Python, and furthering my knowledge in R. I have also taken classes in Excel as it is a useful skill to have as a statistician. In the future, I hope to also learn more C++. e<br><br>

        While I do spend the majority of my time studying statistics, I like to model as a hobby. I like to keep balance in my life, and I realized that if I spent all my time just studying statistics, I would burn out quickly. Thankfully, I was given a huge opportunity to work with Maxim over the summer, which opened a few doors for me in the modeling industry. Finding a balance between two very different career paths was hard, but I was able to teach myself time management as well as learn how to prioritize certain tasks. For example, because I am still a student right now, my task is to increase my GPA for graduate schools. However, over school breaks, I go back to scheduling photoshoots in an attempt to start earning a source of income to pay for graduate school. Being able to find a hobby that helps me further my education in terms of paying for graduate school was really helpful, and brought some fun into my otherwise dull life.
